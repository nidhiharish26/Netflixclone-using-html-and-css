# Netflixclone-using-html-and-css
A Netflix homepage clone using html and css.

This repo has the following files-
* The HTML file for the Netflix web page.
* The first page, that's the login page, is styled by the css file named stylenet.css.
* The pages which explain the features of Netflix following the login page are styled by the css file named stylefeat.css.
* The FAQ page following features page is styled by stylefaq.css file.
* The footer page following it is styled by stylefooter.css file.
* Lastly, the stylemedia.css file is for the reduced viewport width of the website homepage.
* Few image files which was required to design the homepage.

This clone is not responsive as it is designed using only HTML and CSS.
Any suggestions, improvements or PRs would be appreciated!
